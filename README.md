# 🆔 Aadhaar OCR System

A full-stack application for extracting and parsing Aadhaar card data using the power of Tesseract.js, built with a modern TypeScript stack.

## 🚀 Overview

This system enables users to upload images of Aadhaar cards and instantly extract structured information like:

- 🔢 Aadhaar Number  
- 👤 Name  
- 🎂 Date of Birth  
- 🚻 Gender  
- 🏠 Address  
- 📮 Pincode  

OCR is handled using tesseract.js, with custom parsing logic to extract clean and accurate data from scanned Aadhaar cards.
